## 1. Project Overview

“The Econometrician” is a niche, data-driven web platform dedicated to in-depth analysis of development economics, macro-growth, international trade, and political systems. It combines rigorous empirical evidence with modern computational methods (ML, AI, MCMC, text analysis, LLMs) to both inform on current affairs and serve as an educational sandbox for researchers and advanced practitioners.

## 2. Objectives

Current Affairs Hub: Publish timely, rich articles on global economic and political developments, supported by robust data.

Empirical Showcase: Demonstrate real-world applications of advanced statistical and machine-learning methods in economics.

Interactive Learning: Provide tools and tutorials enabling users to explore datasets, replicate analyses, and visualize results dynamically.

## 3. Target Audience

Economists, policy analysts, and PhD-level scholars

Data scientists and quantitative researchers interested in economic applications

Advanced students in development economics, trade policy, and related fields

## 4. Success Criteria

Success - something that remotely matches this - clean, sleek, website: https://www.economicsobservatory.com/

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions

Rely primarily on publicly available data (World Bank, IMF, UN Comtrade). Initial MVP built on Python with HTML front-end. 

## 6. Timeline (High-Level)

June - August: Requirements refinement, data pipeline setup, basic site framework. Content production (articles + visuals), prototype interactive tool

September Onwards: Feature polish, user-testing, launch MVP
